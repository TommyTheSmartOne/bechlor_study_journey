This file is an idea of myself using a transforming function to transfer the data to resolve data cluster in a more
efficient way.
NOTE: the file is just an idea i derive and it does not guarantee to work
The project will proceed in the following way:
1. transfer a input image into a 3d matrix
2. normalize the 3d matrix to make its value between 0 and 1
3. use dimension reduction technique to reduce the dimension to 2 in this case, the input would be the RGB color and output
    would be the data point index in our matrix
4. input the RGB color (dimension reduced) into the transformer function, the output of the function will help
    us determine the 'centroid' the data point belongs to
Transformer function:
    As mentioned before, the transformer function must be symmetric and its y value must be approaching 2 value such that
    f(x) <= y
    In this case we can choose the sigmoid function: f(x) = 2/(1 + e^(-x)) - 1
    The sigmoid function will guarantee the functions output between -1 and 1 and since it is 'symmetric' with the middle
    point 0. In our case, the if the output y value is greater than 0, the data point belongs to the group with 1 as
    centroid, if the output y is smaller than 0, we can consider the value belongs to the group such that centroid is
    -1.
